<div class="grid" markdown>


I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Laboratory of Complex Trait Genomics](https://sites.google.com/edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/kamatanilab/), The University of Tokyo.  <br/><br/> My research focuses on genetic analyses of complex traits and diseases. Specifically, I study the genetic architecture of **gastrointestinal diseases** such as peptic ulcer disease, and **cerebrovascular diseases** such as stroke. <br/><br/> **Research keywords**: Complex trait genomics, Statistical Genetics, GWAS, Gastrointestinal diseases, Cerebrovascular diseases,  Proteomics
